# Clustering-Algorithms
•	Implemented following three clustering algorithms namely K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and Density-based to find clusters of genes in the given gene dataset that exhibit similar expression profiles. Compared the three clustering algorithms based on the external indexes namely RAND index and Jaccard coefficient. Visualized the datasets and clustering results by Principal Component Analysis.
•	Set up a single-node Hadoop cluster on the machine and implemented MapReduce K-means. Compared with non-parallel K-means on the given datasets.
